Certificates with key lengths below 2048 bits are considered cryptographically weak and may be vulnerable to brute-force attacks as computing power increases. Major browser vendors and certificate authorities have mandated 2048-bit minimums since 2014. PCI DSS v4.0.1 (control 4.2.1) requires strong cryptography for data in transit. ACM automatically issues certificates with 2048-bit keys, but imported certificates may have shorter keys if generated externally with weak parameters. Since key length cannot be changed after import, affected certificates must be replaced entirely.",
