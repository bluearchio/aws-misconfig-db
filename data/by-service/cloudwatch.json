Configure detection for services, accounts, and cost categories with custom thresholds. Set up CloudWatch billing alarms for absolute spend thresholds. Integrate with SNS/Slack for real-time notifications. Early detection prevents runaway costs from misconfigurations (e.g., unintended data transfers, EC2 instances in wrong regions, misconfigured Auto Scaling). Organizations report catching 85-95% of cost anomalies within 24 hours.",
