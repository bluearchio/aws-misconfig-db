Major cost drivers: 1) Cross-AZ traffic ($0.01/GB additional), 2) AWS service traffic (S3, DynamoDB) that could use free VPC endpoints, 3) Multiple idle NAT Gateways. Solution: Deploy VPC endpoints for S3/DynamoDB (free data transfer), use Interface endpoints for other services, deploy one NAT Gateway per AZ to eliminate cross-AZ charges.
