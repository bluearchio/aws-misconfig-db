Without a designated security contact, critical notifications such as abuse reports, vulnerability disclosures, and compliance alerts may go to the root account email, which might not be monitored by the security team. This is a CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark v5.0.0 requirement (control 1.2) and maps to NIST 800-53 CM-2. Configuring this contact takes minimal effort and ensures that security-relevant communications reach the right personnel promptly, reducing mean time to response for security incidents.",
