Configure Resource Data Sync to store inventory data in a versioned S3 bucket with event notifications. Deploy a Lambda function to compare inventory versions and detect file changes, creating Security Hub findings for unauthorized modifications.

    "recommendation_description_detailed": "File integrity monitoring (FIM) is a critical security control that detects unauthorized changes to system files, configuration files, and application binaries on EC2 instances. Without FIM, attackers who gain access to an instance can modify critical files (such as application configurations, credential stores, or system binaries) without detection. AWS Systems Manager Inventory provides a scalable, serverless approach to FIM by collecting file metadata and detecting changes through versioned S3 storage and Lambda-based comparison logic. This approach integrates natively with Security Hub for centralized finding management and Security Lake for OCSF-formatted data analysis. FIM is required by multiple compliance frameworks including PCI DSS, HIPAA, and SOC 2.",
