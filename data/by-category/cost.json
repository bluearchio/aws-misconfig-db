We then simulate every combination of reservations in the generated category of usage in order to identify the best number of each type of Reserved Instance to purchase to maximize your savings. This check covers recommendations based on partial upfront payment option with 1-year or 3-year commitment. This check is not available to accounts linked in Consolidated Billing. Recommendations are only available for the Paying Account.",
