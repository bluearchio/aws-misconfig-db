To allow Amazon Route 53 to route queries to the region with the lowest network latency, you should create latency resource record sets for a particular domain name (such as example.com) in different regions. If you create only one latency resource record set for a domain name, all queries are routed to one region, and you pay extra for latency-based routing without getting the benefits. Hosted zones created by AWS services won’t appear in your check results.",
